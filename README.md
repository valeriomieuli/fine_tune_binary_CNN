# fine_tune_binary_CNN


All the code in within the train-test.ipynb notebook.

There are some interesting comments about both what's I did and why I did it.

The notebook is supposed to be run on colab since there it the part where I mount my google drive on the notebook disk.
For this reason, in order to run the notebook on a different environment you would need to change a bit that part of code.

Within the config.py you have all the constants referrring the important paths and some other referring the train and test pipeline.
